This repo automatically checks HYV server every day for launcher updates and saves the new animated backgrounds to:
- [Genshin Impact](https://github.com/nano-shino/hyvbgarchive/tree/master/archive/gopR6Cufr3)
- [Zenless Zone Zero](https://github.com/nano-shino/hyvbgarchive/tree/master/archive/U5hbdsT9W7)

Note that the original videos are in webm format. I convert them to mp4 so you can use them in things like Wallpaper Engine. Some quality may be lost due to this.
